A model is loaded from a file using the SentenceModel class. An instance of the
SentenceDetectorME class is then created using the model, and the sentDetect
method is invoked to perform SDB. The method returns an array of strings, with
each element holding a sentence.
This process is demonstrated in the following example. A try-with-resources block
is used to open the en-sent.bin file, which contains a model. Then the paragraph
string is processed. Next, various IO type exceptions are caught (if necessary).
Finally, a for-each statement is used to display the sentences.
